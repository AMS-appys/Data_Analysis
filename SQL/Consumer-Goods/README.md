Overview:
I recently completed a SQL project analyzing sales data for Atliq Hardware, a top computer hardware company using data to drive growth.

Business Model:
Atliq Hardware sells products through direct channels and retail partnerships, where partners then sell to end users. The aim was to uncover sales trends and growth opportunities

Dataset:
The project used six tables detailing product sales, customer data, and financials from fiscal years 2020-2021.

Task:
I addressed 10 ad-hoc business questions covering sales trends, discount usage, market presence, and product performance.

Approach:
I used SQL (joins, CTEs, subqueries, window functions) to find key insights, and Power BI for visualizations of market reach, sales peaks, and segment trends to aid decision-making.


Outcome:
Key findings include:
- A 36.3% growth in unique products.
- APAC market reach in 8 countries.
- 73% of gross sales driven by retailer channels.
