After conducting an in-depth data analysis, I created a comprehensive dashboard using advanced Data Cleaning and Data Processing techniques. This dashboard visualizes key metrics and trends, providing valuable insights that can drive business decisions.

🔍 Highlights include:
- Monthly trends for Orders vs Sales 📊
- Gender-based Sales split (Women leading with 64%) 👩‍💼👨‍💼
- Top-selling categories: Kurta (34%) and Sets (40%) 👗
- Top-performing states: Maharashtra and Karnataka 🗺️
- Sales by channels: Amazon (36%) taking the lead 🛒
- Order status: 92% Delivered successfully ✅

#Conclusion
- Target women customers of age group (30-49 yrs) living in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh by showing ads/offers/coupons available on Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra

🤖The analysis also breaks down sales across age groups and categories, helping to optimize for various customer demographics. 

🤟This dashboard is not just a representation of numbers, but a tool for making impactful business decisions. 🎯
